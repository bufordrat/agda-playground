This repository contain's Matt's Agda sketches/experiments.
Currently, it contains three main modules:

  Haskell with monads and functors
- =Chapter1.agda= : an attempt to work through the first page or two
  of Givant and Halmos' [[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-68436-9][_Introduction to Boolean Algebras_]]
- =Teller.agda= : an attempt to develop a feel for the differences
  between intuitionistic and classical logic by working through some
  of [[https://tellerprimer.ucdavis.edu/][Paul Teller]] Vol. 2's intro logic exercises
